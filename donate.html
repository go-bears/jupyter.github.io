                released under the liberal terms of the modified BSD license. If you have found Jupyter to be useful in your work, research or company, please consider making a donation to the project commensurate with your resources. Any amount helps!
                All donations will be used strictly to fund the development of Project Jupyter's open source software, documentation
                and community.
