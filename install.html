            <h2>Prerequisite: Python</h2>
            <p>While Jupyter runs code in many programming languages, <strong>Python</strong> is a requirement (Python 3.3 or greater, or Python 2.7) for installing the Jupyter Notebook.</p>
            <p>We recommend using the <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">Anaconda</a> distribution to install Python and Jupyter. We’ll go through its installation in the next section.</p>

            <h2>Installing Jupyter using Anaconda and conda</h2>
            <p>For new users, we <strong>highly recommend</strong> <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">installing Anaconda</a>. Anaconda conveniently installs Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science.</p>
            <p>We recommend using the Anaconda distribution to install Python and Jupyter. We’ll go through its installation in the next section.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Download <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">Anaconda</a>. We recommend downloading Anaconda’s latest Python 3 version (currently Python 3.5).</li>
                <li>Install the version of Anaconda which you downloaded, following the instructions on the download page.</li>
                <li>Congratulations, you have installed Jupyter Notebook. To run the notebook:
                    {% highlight bash %}jupyter notebook{% endhighlight %}
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>See <a href="https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html#running">Running the Notebook</a> for more details.</p>

            <h2>Alternative for experienced Python users: Installing Jupyter with pip</h2>
            <p>As an existing Python user, you may wish to install Jupyter using Python’s package manager, <a href="https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/glossary.html#term-pip">pip</a>, instead of Anaconda.</p>
            <p>First, ensure that you have the latest pip; older versions may have trouble with some dependencies:</p>
            {% highlight bash %}pip3 install --upgrade pip{% endhighlight %}
            <p>Then install the Jupyter Notebook using:</p>
            {% highlight bash %}pip3 install jupyter{% endhighlight %}
            <p>(Use pip if using legacy Python 2.)</p>
            <p>Congratulations. You have installed Jupyter Notebook.</p>
            <p>See <a href="https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html#running">Running the Notebook</a> for more details.</p>
